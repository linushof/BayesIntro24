# Hello `Git`

Below, we take a few steps to get `Git` running on your machine and to allow your machine to communicate (sync) with `GitHub`.
These steps are based on the wonderful [Happy Git and GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) guide, but are much more minimalist with almost no details. 
This is to give you a quick and accessible start.
More details will of course be given, but in class. 
For those who want to dive deeper before and get a head start, take a look into the [Happy Git and GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) guide by Jenny Bryan or read her [intro paper](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/).

<br/><br/>

**Step 1.** Check if `Git` is already installed.

Open a *Terminal* on your system and enter `git --version`.
The command should return something like `git version ...`.
If instead the command returns something like `git: command not found`, follow the link above to install `Git`.

<br/><br/>

**Step 2.** Introduce yourself to `Git`.

Go to the *Terminal* or *Git Bash* and run the first two commands below to enter your username and e-mail.
Make sure you use the same credentials as you used for `GitHub`!
If the third command below returns your username and e-mail, your good to continue.
But first, restart your computer.

``` bash
git config --global user.name 'YOUR USERNAME'
git config --global user.email 'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS'
git config --global --list
```

<br/>

**Step 3.** Connect your local `Git` installation with your `GitHub` account.

Open `RStudio` and install the `usethis` package.
Run the 2nd command below to open your browser and generate a personal access token (PAT).
(The PAT is required to create a secure connection via the HTTPS security protocol. Read more [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).) In the browser window, provide a name for the PAT in the *Note* field (e.g., my-private-machine).
Keep the pre-selected settings and click *Generate token*.
This will open a new window with the PAT.
Don't close this window!

```{r eval = F}
install.packages("usethis")
usethis::create_github_token()
```

<br/><br/>

Return to `RStudio`, install the `gitcreds` package and run the 2nd command below.
A message prompts you to enter your PAT.
Go to the browser, copy the PAT, and paste it to the console and press *Enter*.

```{r eval = F}
install.packages("gitcreds")
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

<br/>

**Step 4.** Create a *remote* repository.

Go to `GitHub` and create a [new repository](https://github.com/new) (repo).

-   [x] *Name*
-   [x] *Public*
-   [x] *Add README file*

**Congrats, you just created your first (GitHub) repository!** 

<br/>

**Step 5.** Clone the remote repo to your computer.

Click the green "\<\> Code" button and *HTTPS*.
Copy the URL address to your clipboard.

![](screenshots/repo-url.png){fig-align="center"}

Go to *RStudio* and create a new Git project: *File* \> *New Project ...* \> *Version Control* \> *Git*.
Paste the repository URL in the respective field of the pop-up window.
The name of the remote repository will be automatically set as the name for you project folder.
In the bottom field, indicate where on your machine you want to create the project.
(We will also speak of this project folder as the *local* repo, which we'll keep in sync with the remote repo on `GitHub`.) 
Click "Create project" and `RStudio` will open the project.

<br/><br/>

**Congrats, you just cloned your first repository from GitHub to your machine!** 

<br/>

**Step 6.** Make your first commit and push to `GitHub`.


By creating the `RStudio` project using the `GitHub` URL, you already created a connection between the local repo/project on your machine and the the remote repo on `GitHub`.
However, this is only where it get's started.

Now, take a look at the main page of your `GitHub` repo.
You'll find a list of all files of this remote repo.
Currently, there is only the `README.md` file.
When clicking on this file, you'll see one line, indicating the repo title.
`README` files are often used to share the most important information about a project with others (e.g., the purpose of the project, the project status, how to best navigate through the files, general instructions, and more).
Because of their importance, the contents of the `README.md` file are also directly shown on the main page of your `GitHub` repo (go back to the main page to check).

![](screenshots/github-readme.png){fig-align="center"}

<br/><br/>

Next, go back to `RStudio` and visit the *File* and *Git* pane, shown in the figure below.
The *File* pane displays a list of all files of this local repo.
You'll find the `README.md` file, which you synced with `GitHub` when creating this project using the `GitHub` URL (Step 5), but also a couple of other files such as `.gitignore` and `*name.Rproj`, which were automatically generated when creating this project in `RStudio`.
The *Git* pane shows the *track and commit status* of your files: 

- Two yellow `??` indicate that the file is not tracked by `Git` yet. 

- A blue `M` indicates that the file is tracked, but the latest changes to this file are not *committed* to `Git` yet. 

- When a project file is not shown in the `Git` pane, then `Git` ignores this file (because you said so) or the latest changes are already committed.

::: {.callout-note}
Intermezzo: What is a commit? 

In a classic workflow that involves only you and your computer (and perhaps a standard cloud), you change a file (e.g., add a new code snippet or paragraph) and keep the new file version, while loosing the old version (prior the changes have been made).
`Git` instead allows you to keep both the new version and the entire file history (that is, all changes that ever have been made to this file).
To do this, you need to not only save a file after the recent changes, but also commit them to `Git`. 
A commit indicates that you move from an earlier file version to a new version and keep both the old and the new version as separate "snapshots" of this file. 
If your project progresses over time and you realize you made a big mistake some commits ago, you can just jump back to an earlier version that you were still happy with.
All this works without `GitHub`.

The connection to `GitHub` allows you to additionally store the current version and file history remotely in a cloud store (rather than just on your machine).
This is an important feature on its own, but `GitHub` gives you many other benefits such as collaborating with others on the same project.
You'll learn about them in class.
:::


Normally, you want to keep the local repo on your machine and the remote repo on `GitHub` in sync.
Let's look at how this works.
In `RStudio`, open the `README.md` file, write a new line, save it.
Now, look at what changed in the `RStudio`'s `Git` pane:
You should now see the `README.md` file and a blue `M`.
This indicates, that you made a change to the file, but you did not commit them yet.
That is, `Git` still considers the file without the new line as the most recent version.


![](screenshots/readme-new-line.png){fig-align="center"}

<br/><br/>

Next, you want to commit the new changes to `Git`.
To do so, first *stage* the file by ticking the box to the left of the file and then clicking the *Commit* button.

![](screenshots/git-staging.png){fig-align="center"}

<br/><br/>

A new window opens, where you can review the changes and need to write a short and meaningful *commit message*.

![](screenshots/git-commit-message.png){fig-align="center"}

<br/><br/>

After clicking the *Commit* button, another window opens and you should see a short message summarizing the successful commit.

The file without the changes is now considered an old version (which is stored in the history) and the file with the changes is considered the current version. 
The file should be disappeared from the `Git` pane and show up again only when you make new changes and save the file.

Finally, after one or several file changes and commits---you'll likely commit more often than you push---click the green *Push* arrow (button) in the *Git* pane.
This will sync the latest commits with the `GitHub` repo.
As before when you committed the changes, you should see a short message in the popup window informing about a successful push to `GitHub`.
To see that it really worked, visit *GitHub* and check if the new line shows up in the `README.md` file.

**Congratulations, you made your first `Git` commit and pushed it to `GitHub`. This is huge!**


Now that your system is set up to work with `RStudio`, `Git` and `GitHub`, we'll take the next session to learn about other relevant features of these tools, including how to use them for collaborating in coding/data analysis projects. 

Looking forward to seeing you in class! :)
